# Multi-level-Feedback-Queue

Programming language used: Java  

A simulation of Multi-level feedback queue scheduling algorithm with GUI (Complete with tabled results and add new tab functionality).  

This application can also be used to compare different Scheduling algorithms such as FIFO, Priority with and without pre-emption, Round Robin, SJF, and SRT.

1. Just run the MLFQ_Driver Class and GUI will automatically start.  (See comments on MLFQ_Driver.java on how to run the program without running GUI)
2. If you ran the GUI, you can browse for a file with the format below (or view testCases folder for sample)
      0 0 0 0 where id, arrivalTime, burstTime, priority num  
        or  
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 where id arrivalTime, burstTime, priorityNum, waitingTime, turnaroundTime, endTime  
3. See results pane for logs and results.
